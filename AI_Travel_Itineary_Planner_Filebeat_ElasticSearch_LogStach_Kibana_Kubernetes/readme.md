# ü§ñ AI Travel Planner Chatbot on Kubernetes: Full-Stack Observability with the ELK Stack

This project showcases a production-grade deployment of an **AI-powered Travel Itinerary Planner Chatbot** on Kubernetes, with a dedicated, decoupled logging and monitoring pipeline using the **Elastic Stack (ELK)**.

## üí° Project Thesis: Cloud-Native Observability

Our core achievement is demonstrating a **robust, scalable architecture** where the Chatbot's operational health, user interactions, and error logs are streamed in real-time into a dedicated observability stack. This ensures operational stability and rapid diagnostics in a distributed microservices environment.
